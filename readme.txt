Solve the WooCommerce coupon's individual use problem and choose which coupons can be used together or not

== Description ==

== Remove WooCommerce coupons limitations ==
If you use WooCommerce coupons, you already know they have a big limitation. It’s either one coupon or as many coupons as possible.
There’s no middle ground.
Thanks to this plugin, you can lift this limitation and decide which coupons can be used together or not.

== Create Exclusive Coupon Categories ==
In WooCommerce’s Marketing menu, you will get the possibility to create Exclusive Categories.
* You can create as many categories as you want
* Coupons can have multiple categories
* You can assign categories in bulk to your coupons
* You can sort your coupons by category in the coupons page

== Manage coupon exclusions ==
The idea is simple: If you set an exclusive category to a coupon, it can’t be used with other coupons with the same category.
However, if you have 2 coupons with different categories, they can be used on the same cart, even if you checked the “Individual Use Only” option.
This lets you decide easily what coupons can be used together or not, allowing much more diversity in your discount campaigns.

== Don’t get lost ==
Thanks to an inline and graphic help in the coupon edition screen, you’ll always know how the system works and how to set up your coupons the way you want.

== Compatible with other plugins ==
Individual Use Solver for WooCommerce Coupons is a plugin that works well with other plugins:
•	Smart Coupons for WooCommerce: You can create categories inside smart coupons and exclusive categories at the same time. Each category type will serve its own purpose
•	**[WooRewards](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woorewards/)**: Combine your coupons and your loyalty program. You can decide that customers can use their loyalty points or coupons in addition to some of your other coupons or not.
